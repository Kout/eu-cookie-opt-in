{"name":"EU Cookie Opt in/out Script","body":"EU - Cookie Opt in-out\r\n================\r\n\r\nThis Cookie scripts will give you an user interface where visitors can optin or out to allow your website to user cookies. (An inspiration from BT.com). Once user opts for a level privacy you can load various async scripts. \r\n\r\nFor example if user don't opt for targeting level you will not load or include your google analytics code. You can define a strict level of cookies required for your website to work and mention it on the functionalList option while initializing the cookie manager code. \r\n\r\nAn optimized mobile version is also coming soon.

At the same time the UK updated its Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, which brought the EU Directive it into UK law. \r\n\r\nEach EU member state has done or is doing the same thing. Although they all have their own approach and interpretation, the basic requirements of the directive remain the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Usage ####\r\n\r\nSimple include the cookie javascript file on your page and initilize cookie manage on page load.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <html>\r\n    <head>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n        <h1>Cookie Manager</h1>\r\n        \t<ul>\r\n          <li><a href='javascript:EU.CookiePreferenceUI.toggleOptions();void(0);'>Change Settings</a></li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n          <script type=\"text/javascript\" src='cookie.debug.min.js'></script>\r\n          <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n            window.onload = init;\r\n    \r\n        \t\tfunction init() {\r\n              EU.CookieManager.init({\r\n              expires: 20, // Define the expiry time for the cookie\r\n              cookie_prefix: 'EU_', // prefix for the cookie\r\n              optin_cookie_name: 'OPTIN', // cookie name\r\n              test:false, \r\n              idle:0, // Time in seconds of you want the initial popup to close automatically if user dont intract with it. \r\n              link: 'cookie.html', // Linkf or the page if you want to include a page for cookie information for user. \r\n              functionalList: { // Functionality list for all three levels. \r\n                'strict': {\r\n                  'will' : ['Remember what is in your shopping basket', 'Remember cookie access level.'],\r\n                  'willnot': ['Send information to other websites so that advertising is more relevant to you', 'Remember your log-in details', 'Improve overall performance of the website', 'Provide you with live, online chat support']\r\n                },\r\n                'functional': {\r\n                  'will' : ['Remember what is in your shopping basket', 'Remember cookie access level.','Remember your log-in details','Make sure the website looks consistent','Offer live chat support'],\r\n                  'willnot': ['Allow you to share pages with social networks like Facebook', 'Allow you to comment on blogs', 'Send information to other websites so that advertising is more relevant to you']\r\n                },\r\n                'targeting': {\r\n                  'will' : ['Remember what is in your shopping basket', 'Remember cookie access level.','Remember your log-in details','Make sure the website looks consistent','Offer live chat support','Send information to other websites so that advertising is more relevant to you'],\r\n                  'willnot': []\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n            });\r\n        \t\t}\r\n    \t</script>\r\n    </body>\r\n  </html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Check subscription ####\r\n\r\nYou can use EU.Cookie.hasSubscribed(); method to check if the user has enabled cookies.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n        if (EU.Cookie.hasSubscribed()) {\r\n            /**\r\n                Google Analytics Code Here or any other tracking code.\r\n            **/    \r\n        }\r\n    </script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Get selected level ####\r\n\r\nYou can use getLevel method to retrieve the selected level\r\n\r\n```html\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n        var selectedLevel = EU.Cookie.getLevel();\r\n        if ( selectedLevel === '2') {\r\n          // eg.
